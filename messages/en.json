    "title": "The Festival",
    "offbcn-1": "OFFBCN FESTIVAL is not just an event; it’s an immersive experience where the dance floor becomes a space for collective exploration. More than a festival, it is a meeting point for those who see electronic music as a form of expression—a culture that transcends genres and generations.",
    "offbcn-2": "Here, raving is not just a celebration but a statement of intent. OFFBCN honors the history of electronic music, from the early house and techno rhythms to today’s most cutting-edge sounds. Every set, every visual, every gathering is part of a narrative that defies time, proving that the raver spirit is unshakable yet always evolving. More than a festival, OFFBCN is a borderless community—a laboratory of innovation where club culture merges with art and technology. It’s a call to those who feel the bass as their own heartbeat. In Barcelona, under the sky of Parc del Fòrum, a new chapter of this story is written each year: the rave continues, because dancing is eternal.",
